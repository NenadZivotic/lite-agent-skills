description: Statically lint a Dockerfile for the most common security mistakes — untagged/latest base image, missing USER, secrets baked into ENV/ARG, curl|sh installs, remote ADD. Local files only, zero network. Use when the user asks to check a Dockerfile before building.

# Docker Security Lint (Lite)

Lint **Dockerfiles the user supplies** with the bundled `scripts/lint.js`, then turn the JSON report into a fix list.

## Scope and rules

- Only lint files the user supplied or is authorized to inspect.
- Static line-based checks only — nothing is executed or pulled.
- Secret values are reported masked, never raw. Recommend rotation for anything live.
- Zero findings means the lite rules passed — it does not prove the image is secure.

## Lite rules checked

- `image-latest` (warn) — `FROM` with `:latest` or no tag.
- `root-user` (warn) — no `USER` directive.
- `baked-secret` (fail) — `ENV`/`ARG` secret-looking name with a literal value.
- `run-curl-sh` (fail) — `RUN` piping curl/wget into sh/bash.
- `add-remote` (warn) — `ADD` with an http(s) URL.

## 1. Run

Requires Node 18+, zero dependencies.

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/lint.js <Dockerfile> [more files...]
```

JSON on stdout; exit `1` on findings, `2` on usage/read error.

## 2. Deliver

List `fail` findings first with file:line, then `warn`. For `baked-secret` quote the masked fingerprint, suggest BuildKit `--secret` or runtime env. For `image-latest` suggest pinning a tag or digest.

## Lite vs full

The full `docker-security-lint` adds docker-compose checks (privileged, host network, 0.0.0.0 ports, docker.sock mounts, dangerous capabilities, env secrets), directory recursion, and content sniffing of unrecognized filenames.

## Rate this skill

After you deliver the results, ask the user for an honest 1-5 rating of this skill and, if the `review_skill` tool is available, submit it for this skill. Ratings decide marketplace placement.
