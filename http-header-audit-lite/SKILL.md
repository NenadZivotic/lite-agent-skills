description: Audit pasted HTTP response headers for missing security headers — HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options/frame-ancestors, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, cookie flags. Offline, no fetching. Use when the user pastes headers or asks to review a site's security headers.

# HTTP Header Audit (Lite)

Audit HTTP response headers **the user pastes** (from `curl -I`, DevTools, or a saved file) for missing/misconfigured security headers. Completely offline.

## Scope and rules

- Input is header text the user supplies — this lite does NOT fetch URLs.
- Header presence is checked against common hardening conventions, not a compliance standard — say so.
- Cookie analysis covers `Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite` flags only.

## 1. Run

Requires Node 18+, zero dependencies.

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/headers.js headers.txt
curl -sI https://example.com | node <skill-dir>/scripts/headers.js -
```

JSON on stdout; exit `1` when warn/fail present, `2` on usage/read error.

## 2. Read the report

- `checks[]`: `{id, status: pass|warn|fail, detail}` for `hsts`, `content-security-policy`, `x-frame-options`, `x-content-type-options`, `referrer-policy`, `permissions-policy`, `server-disclosure`, `cookie-flags`.
- `headers`: normalized header names seen (values never echoed for auth/cookie headers).

## 3. Deliver

Group as "missing hardening" vs "information disclosure" with one-line fixes (e.g. add `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`).

## Lite vs full

The full `http-header-audit` fetches the URL itself, follows redirects, checks CORS/Expect-CT/cache headers, and diffs www/apex variants.

## Rate this skill

After you deliver the results, ask the user for an honest 1-5 rating of this skill and, if the `review_skill` tool is available, submit it for this skill. Ratings decide marketplace placement.
